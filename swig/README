General Notes
-------------

These are SWIG bindings to generate a python wrapper for the c++ library. You will require the numpy.i interface file (from numpy code distribution).

Build Instructions
------------------

These commands should build a working version of the python library. Note that a patch is required probably because the binfile.i interface is not as good as it could be.

swig -python -c++ binfile.i
patch binfile_wrapper.cxx < patch
python setup.py build_ext
